    "2.Machine Learning: Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on teaching computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It's like giving machines the ability to learn and make predictions based on patterns and data. It's used in many applications like image recognition,speech recognition and recommendation systems.\n",
