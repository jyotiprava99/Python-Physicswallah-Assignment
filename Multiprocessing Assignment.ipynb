    "1. **Multiprocessing in Python**:\n",
    "   - Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability to create and manage multiple processes concurrently within the same program.\n",
    "   - It is useful for tasks that can be parallelized, such as CPU-bound operations, as it allows programs to utilize multiple CPU cores effectively.\n",
    "   - Multiprocessing enables better performance and scalability compared to single-threaded or multithreaded applications, especially on systems with multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Differences between Multiprocessing and Multithreading**:\n",
    "   - **Concurrency**: Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes concurrently, each with its own memory space, while multithreading involves running multiple threads within the same process, sharing the same memory space.\n",
    "   - **Resource Isolation**: Processes are isolated from each other and have separate memory spaces, whereas threads within the same process share memory.\n",
    "   - **Overhead**: Multiprocessing generally has higher overhead due to the need for inter-process communication, while multithreading has lower overhead as threads within the same process can communicate more efficiently.\n",
    "   - **Parallelism**: Multiprocessing provides true parallelism as processes can run on multiple CPU cores simultaneously, while multithreading may not achieve true parallelism due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Python Code to Create a Process**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "   def worker():\n",
    "       print(\"Worker process\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "       p = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker)\n",
    "       p.start()\n",
    "       p.join()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multiprocessing Pool in Python**:\n",
    "   - A multiprocessing pool is a way to distribute tasks across multiple worker processes in Python.\n",
    "   - It is used to parallelize operations by dividing them into smaller tasks and distributing them among the worker processes in the pool.\n",
    "   - The pool manages the creation and management of worker processes, allowing for efficient parallel execution of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Creating a Pool of Worker Processes**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "   def worker(num):\n",
    "       print(f\"Worker {num}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "       with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4) as pool:\n",
    "           pool.map(worker, range(4))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Python Program to Create 4 Processes**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "   def print_number(num):\n",
    "       print(f\"Process {num}: {num}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "       processes = []\n",
    "       for i in range(4):\n",
    "           p = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_number, args=(i,))\n",
    "           processes.append(p)\n",
    "           p.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "       for p in processes:\n",
