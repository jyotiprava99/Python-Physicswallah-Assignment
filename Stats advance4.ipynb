    "Q1: The main difference between a t-test and a z-test lies in the assumptions about the population standard deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known or when the sample size is large (typically n > 30), making the sample standard deviation a good estimate of the population standard deviation.\n",
    "Example: Testing whether the mean weight of a product is different from a specified value when the population standard deviation of weights is known.\n",

    "Example: Testing whether a new drug increases blood pressure (one-tailed greater than test).\n",
