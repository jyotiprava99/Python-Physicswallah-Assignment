    " Abstraction and encapsulation are two important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), but they serve different purposes.\n",
    "Abstraction focuses on hiding complex details and exposing only essential information. It allows us to work with objects at a higher level \n",
    "of understanding without worrying about the internal implementation. For example, when using a car,\n",
    "we don't need to know how the engine works or how the transmission system functions. We only need to know how to\n",
    "drive the car, which is the essential information required for our task.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, encapsulation is about bundling related data and methods into a single unit, which is called a class. \n",
    "It provides data hiding and protects the internal state of an object from direct access. Encapsulation allows us to control access\n",
    "to the internal data and ensures that it is manipulated only through defined methods. For example, in a class representing a bank account, \n",
    "we can have private variables like the account balance, and we provide public methods like deposit and withdraw to interact with the account.\n",
    "This way, the internal state of the account is encapsulated and can only be accessed and modified through the defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, abstraction focuses on hiding complexity and exposing essential information, while encapsulation focuses on bundling related data and methods \n",
    "together and controlling access to them. Both concepts contribute to writing modular, maintainable, and secure code in OOP."
