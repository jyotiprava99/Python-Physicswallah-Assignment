    "Q1. When creating a custom exception in Python, it is recommended to inherit from the `Exception` class or one of its subclasses. Here's why:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- Inheriting from the `Exception` class allows your custom exception to inherit all the behaviors and attributes of the base `Exception` class. This includes features such as stack traces, error messages, and the ability to catch your custom exception using `except` blocks.\r\n",
    "- The `Exception` class serves as the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python. By inheriting from it, you ensure that your custom exception follows the same conventions and interfaces as other built-in exceptions.\r\n",
    "- Inheriting from `Exception` also makes it clear to other developers that your class is intended to be used as an exception. It provides a consistent approach to defining and handling errors in Python code.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Q2. Here's a Python program to print the Python Exception Hierarchy:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "import builtins\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "def print_exception_hierarchy(exception_class, indent=0):\r\n",
    "    print(' ' * indent + exception_class.__name__)\r\n",
    "    for subclass in exception_class.__subclasses__():\r\n",
    "        print_exception_hierarchy(subclass, indent + 4)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "print_exception_hierarchy(builtins.BaseException)\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This program recursively prints the exception hierarchy starting from `BaseException`. It will display the hierarchy of all built-in exceptions in Python.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Q3. The `ArithmeticError` class in Python defines errors that occur during arithmetic operations. Two errors defined in this class are:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **ZeroDivisionError**: Raised when division or modulo operation is performed with zero as the divisor.\r\n",
    "  Example:\r\n",
    "  ```python\r\n",
    "  try:\r\n",
    "      result = 10 / 0\r\n",
    "  except ZeroDivisionError:\r\n",
    "      print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\r\n",
    "  ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **OverflowError**: Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented within the available numeric type.\r\n",
    "  Example:\r\n",
    "  ```python\r\n",
    "  try:\r\n",
    "      result = 2 ** 10000  # Raises OverflowError\r\n",
    "  except OverflowError:\r\n",
    "      print(\"Result too large to handle!\")\r\n",
    "  ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Q4. The `LookupError` class in Python is used to handle errors related to lookup operations, such as accessing elements in a sequence or dictionary. Two common errors under `LookupError` are `KeyError` and `IndexError`:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **KeyError**: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.\r\n",
    "  Example:\r\n",
    "  ```python\r\n",
    "  my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\r\n",
    "  try:\r\n",
    "      value = my_dict['c']\r\n",
    "  except KeyError:\r\n",
    "      print(\"Key not found!\")\r\n",
    "  ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **IndexError**: Raised when trying to access an index that is out of range in a sequence (e.g., list, tuple).\r\n",
    "  Example:\r\n",
    "  ```python\r\n",
    "  my_list = [1, 2, 3]\r\n",
    "  try:\r\n",
    "      value = my_list[3]\r\n",
    "  except IndexError:\r\n",
    "      print(\"Index out of range!\")\r\n",
    "  ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Q5. **ImportError**: ImportError is raised when an import statement fails to import a module. This can occur if the module does not exist, if there are issues with the module's code, or if there are problems with the Python environment.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   **ModuleNotFoundError**: ModuleNotFoundError is a subclass of ImportError. It specifically indicates that the module being imported does not exist.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   Example:\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   try:\r\n",
    "       import non_existent_module\r\n",
    "   except ModuleNotFoundError:\r\n",
    "       print(\"Module does not exist!\")\r\n",
    "   ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Q6. Some best practices for exception handling in Python include:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- Be specific in exception handling: Catch specific exceptions rather than using a generic `except` block.\r\n",
    "- Handle exceptions gracefully: Provide meaningful error messages and handle exceptions in a way that maintains the stability of the program.\r\n",
    "- Use `try-except-else-finally` blocks appropriately: Use `else` for code that should run only if no exceptions occur, and use `finally` for cleanup tasks.\r\n",
    "- Keep exception handling concise: Avoid overly nested `try-except` blocks or overly long `try` blocks.\r\n",
    "- Document exceptions: Clearly document the exceptions that can be raised by functions or methods, along with the circumstances under which they occur.\r\n",
    "- Use logging: Use Python's logging module to log exceptions and other important information for debugging and monitoring purposes.\r\n",
    "- Follow PEP 8 guidelines: Adhere to Python's coding conventions, including naming conventions for exceptions and using consistent indentation and formatting."
