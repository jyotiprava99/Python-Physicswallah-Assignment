    "Q1. Assumptions for ANOVA:\n",
    "   - Independence: Observations within each group are independent of each other.\n",
    "   - Normality: The residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) are normally distributed within each group.\n",
    "   - Homogeneity of variance: The variances of the populations from which the samples are drawn are equal (homoscedasticity).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Violations impacting validity:\n",
    "   - Non-normality: If the residuals are not normally distributed, it can affect the accuracy of p-values and confidence intervals.\n",
    "   - Non-homogeneity of variance: Unequal variances can inflate the Type I error rate and reduce the power of the test.\n",
    "   - Lack of independence: Violation of independence assumption can lead to inaccurate estimation of p-values and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Three types of ANOVA:\n",
    "   - One-way ANOVA: Used when comparing the means of three or more independent groups on one dependent variable.\n",
    "   - Two-way ANOVA: Used when there are two independent variables (factors), each with multiple levels, and one dependent variable.\n",
    "   - Repeated measures ANOVA: Used when the same subjects are measured at multiple time points or under multiple conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Partitioning of variance in ANOVA:\n",
    "   ANOVA decomposes the total variance observed in the data into different components:\n",
    "   - Total sum of squares (SST): Variability of the dependent variable across all observations.\n",
    "   - Explained sum of squares (SSE): Variability in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable(s).\n",
    "   - Residual sum of squares (SSR): Unexplained variability in the dependent variable after accounting for the effects of the independent variable(s).\n",
    "   Understanding this concept is important because it helps assess the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be attributed to the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Calculation of SST, SSE, and SSR in one-way ANOVA using Python:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "Q6. Interpretation of a one-way ANOVA result:\n",
    "   The obtained F-statistic of 5.23 with a p-value of 0.02 indicates that there is a statistically significant difference between the groups' means. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis of equal means among the groups. However, further post-hoc tests would be necessary to determine which specific groups differ significantly from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Handling missing data in repeated measures ANOVA:\n",
    "   - Pairwise deletion: Exclude cases with missing data on a pairwise basis. This may lead to loss of power and biased estimates if data are not missing completely at random.\n",
    "   - Imputation: Replace missing values with estimated values using various imputation methods such as mean imputation or regression imputation. However, this may introduce bias and underestimate variability.\n",
    "   - Maximum likelihood estimation: Utilize all available data to estimate model parameters. This method is preferred when data are missing at random, but it can be computationally intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Common post-hoc tests after ANOVA:\n",
    "   - Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test: Used to identify which group means differ significantly from each other. It controls the familywise error rate.\n",
    "   - Bonferroni correction: Adjusts the significance threshold for multiple comparisons to maintain the overall significance level.\n",
    "   - Scheffe's method: Provides a conservative approach to pairwise comparisons while controlling the Type I error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: After conducting a one-way ANOVA to compare the effectiveness of three teaching methods on student performance, a post-hoc test like Tukey's HSD would be necessary to determine which specific pairs of teaching methods show significant differences in performance.\n",
