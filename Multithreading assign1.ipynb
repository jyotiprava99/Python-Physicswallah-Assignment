    "1. **Multithreading in Python**:\n",
    "   - Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within the same process. Each thread represents a separate flow of control, allowing tasks to be executed concurrently.\n",
    "   - It is used to improve the responsiveness of applications by performing multiple tasks simultaneously, making efficient use of CPU resources, and enabling parallelism.\n",
    "   - The module used to handle threads in Python is called the `threading` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Threading Module**:\n",
    "   - The `threading` module in Python is used to handle threads.\n",
    "   - `activeCount()`: Returns the number of active threads in the current program.\n",
    "   - `currentThread()`: Returns the current thread object.\n",
    "   - `enumerate()`: Returns a list of all active Thread objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Thread Functions**:\n",
    "   - `run()`: Defines the entry point for the thread's activity. It's called when the `start()` method is called.\n",
    "   - `start()`: Starts the thread's activity by calling the `run()` method.\n",
    "   - `join()`: Waits for the thread to complete its execution.\n",
    "   - `isAlive()`: Returns True if the thread is currently executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Python Program with Threads**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "   def print_squares():\n",
    "       for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "           print(f\"Square of {i} is {i*i}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   def print_cubes():\n",
    "       for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "           print(f\"Cube of {i} is {i*i*i}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   t1 = threading.Thread(target=print_squares)\n",
    "   t2 = threading.Thread(target=print_cubes)\n",
    "\n",
    "   t1.start()\n",
    "   t2.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "   t1.join()\n",
    "   t2.join()\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "5. **Advantages and Disadvantages of Multithreading**:\n",
    "   - **Advantages**:\n",
    "     - Improved performance: Utilizes multiple CPU cores simultaneously, leading to faster execution of tasks.\n",
    "     - Better responsiveness: Allows applications to remain responsive during time-consuming operations.\n",
    "     - Resource sharing: Threads can share resources within the same process, reducing memory consumption and overhead.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "     - Complexity: Multithreading introduces complexity due to potential race conditions, deadlocks, and synchronization issues.\n",
    "     - Debugging difficulty: Debugging multithreaded applications can be challenging, as issues may arise due to non-deterministic behavior.\n",
    "     - GIL limitations: In Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallelism, making it less effective for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Deadlocks and Race Conditions**:\n",
    "   - **Deadlock**: Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources that they need to proceed. As a result, all threads become stuck, and the program hangs indefinitely.\n",
    "   - **Race Condition**: A race condition occurs when the outcome of a program depends on the relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads. It arises when multiple threads access shared resources without proper synchronization, leading to unpredictable behavior.\n",
