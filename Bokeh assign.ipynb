    "**Q1. How can you create a Bokeh plot using Python code?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a Bokeh plot using Python code, you first need to import the necessary modules from Bokeh. Then, you can create a figure object and add glyphs (visual elements) to it using methods like `line()`, `circle()`, etc. Finally, you can show or save the plot using the `show()` or `save()` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic example of creating a Bokeh plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a figure object\n",
    "p = figure(title=\"Simple Line Plot\", x_axis_label=\"X-axis\", y_axis_label=\"Y-axis\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add a line glyph\n",
    "p.line([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 2, 4, 5], line_width=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show the plot\n",
    "show(p)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What are glyphs in Bokeh, and how can you add them to a Bokeh plot? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Glyphs are visual markers that represent data points on a plot, such as lines, circles, squares, etc. You can add glyphs to a Bokeh plot using methods like `line()`, `circle()`, `square()`, etc., provided by the figure object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of adding glyphs to a Bokeh plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a figure object\n",
    "p = figure(title=\"Glyph Example\", x_axis_label=\"X-axis\", y_axis_label=\"Y-axis\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add glyphs\n",
    "p.line([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 2, 4, 5], line_width=2, legend_label=\"Line\")\n",
    "p.circle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 2, 4, 5], size=10, color=\"red\", legend_label=\"Circle\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show the plot\n",
    "show(p)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. How can you customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot, including the axes, title, and legend?**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can customize various aspects of a Bokeh plot, such as axes, title, legend, etc., using attributes and methods provided by the figure object. For example, you can set titles for axes and the plot, customize axis ticks, labels, legend placement, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of customizing a Bokeh plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a figure object with customizations\n",
    "p = figure(title=\"Customized Plot\", x_axis_label=\"X-axis\", y_axis_label=\"Y-axis\",\n",
    "           plot_width=400, plot_height=300, toolbar_location=\"above\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Customize axes\n",
    "p.xaxis.axis_label_text_color = \"blue\"\n",
    "p.yaxis.axis_label_text_font_style = \"italic\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add glyphs\n",
    "p.circle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 2, 4, 5], size=10, color=\"red\", legend_label=\"Data Points\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Customize legend\n",
    "p.legend.location = \"bottom_right\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show the plot\n",
    "show(p)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What is a Bokeh server, and how can you use it to create interactive plots that can be updated in real time?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bokeh server is a Python server that allows you to create and serve Bokeh applications, which are interactive plots or dashboards. With the Bokeh server, you can create complex interactive plots that respond to user inputs or data updates in real time. You can use the Bokeh server to add widgets, callbacks, and other interactive elements to your plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Bokeh server, you need to define a Python script or application that creates the Bokeh plot and defines the interactions or updates you want to include. Then, you run the Bokeh server using the `bokeh serve` command, passing it the path to your Python script or application. The Bokeh server will host your application, allowing users to access it through a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. How can you embed a Bokeh plot into a web page or dashboard using Flask or Django?**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can embed Bokeh plots into web pages or dashboards built with Flask or Django by using the `components()` function provided by Bokeh. This function generates the HTML and JavaScript code needed to embed a Bokeh plot into a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic example of embedding a Bokeh plot into a Flask application:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, render_template\n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure\n",
    "from bokeh.embed import components\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    # Create a Bokeh plot\n",
    "    p = figure()\n",
    "    p.circle([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Generate HTML and JavaScript components\n",
    "    script, div = components(p)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Render the HTML template with the plot components\n",
    "    return render_template('index.html', script=script, div=div)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `components()` function is used to generate the `script` and `div` components of the Bokeh plot. These components are then passed to a Flask template (index.html) where they are embedded into the HTML page.\n",
