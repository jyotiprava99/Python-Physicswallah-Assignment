    "ans: In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. This could be due to various reasons such as invalid user input, trying to access a file that doesn't exist, or attempting to perform an operation on incompatible data types.\n",

    "Here's a brief comparison between exceptions and syntax errors in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions occur during the execution of a program.\n",
    "They are typically caused by conditions that occur while the program is running, such as division by zero, trying to access an index that doesn't exist in a list, or attempting to open a file that doesn't exist.\n",
    "Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks, allowing the program to gracefully recover from errors.\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, occur during the parsing of code by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "They are typically caused by mistakes in the code structure, such as missing parentheses, incorrect indentation, or using invalid syntax.\n",
    "Syntax errors prevent the code from being executed at all and must be fixed before the program can run.\n",
    "Common examples include misspelling keywords, omitting colons after control flow statements, or mismatched parentheses."

If no handler is found, the default behavior is for the program to terminate, and an error message is displayed, indicating the type of exception and the traceback, which shows the sequence of function calls leading up to the exception."

    "In Python, the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` statements are used to catch and handle exceptions. Here's a brief overview of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **try**: This statement is used to enclose the code block where exceptions may occur. It allows you to define a block of code that might raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **except**: This statement is used to catch exceptions that occur within the `try` block. You can specify the type of exception you want to catch, or you can catch all exceptions by using a generic `except` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **else**: This optional statement can be used in conjunction with `try` and `except` blocks. The code inside the `else` block is executed if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **finally**: This optional statement is used to define a block of code that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's typically used for cleanup tasks, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic example demonstrating the usage of these statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code block where exceptions may occur\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    # Exception handling specific to ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code block executed if no exceptions occur\n",
    "    print(\"Division successful. Result:\", result)\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # Cleanup code that always runs\n",
    "    print(\"Exiting try-except block.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, if a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs within the `try` block, the program jumps to the corresponding `except` block to handle the exception. If no exception occurs, the code inside the `else` block is executed. Finally, the code inside the `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not."

    "1. **try**: The `try` statement in Python is used to enclose a block of code in which exceptions may occur. It allows you to test a block of code for errors. If an exception occurs within the `try` block, Python looks for an `except` block that matches the type of exception raised. If it finds one, it jumps to that block to handle the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Code block where exceptions may occur\n",
    "        result = 10 / 0  # This line may raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **else**: The `else` statement in Python is optional and is used in conjunction with a `try` statement. It follows all the `except` blocks. The code inside the `else` block is executed only if no exceptions occur in the preceding `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        # Code block where exceptions may occur\n",

    "        # Cleanup code that always runs\n",
    "        print(\"Exiting try-except block.\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **raise**: The `raise` statement is used to explicitly raise an exception. It allows you to create custom exceptions or re-raise exceptions that have been caught. You can either raise a built-in exception type or a custom exception class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    x = -1\n",
    "    if x < 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"x cannot be negative\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These statements collectively provide a way to handle exceptions gracefully, execute code only when no exceptions occur, and ensure that cleanup tasks are performed regardless of whether an exception occurred."

    "Custom exceptions in Python are user-defined exception classes that inherit from the built-in `Exception` class or one of its subclasses. By creating custom exceptions, developers can define their own types of errors specific to their application domain. These exceptions can then be raised and caught like any other built-in exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of defining a custom exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyCustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With this definition, `MyCustomError` becomes a new type of exception that can be raised and caught in Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasons for Using Custom Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Semantic Clarity**: Custom exceptions allow developers to give meaningful names to the errors that occur within their codebase. This improves the readability and maintainability of the code by providing clear information about the nature of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Application-specific Errors**: Different applications have unique requirements and constraints. Custom exceptions allow developers to define errors that are specific to their application domain, making it easier to handle and debug those errors appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hierarchy of Exceptions**: By organizing custom exceptions into a hierarchy, developers can create a structured approach to error handling. This enables more granular control over exception handling and allows different parts of the code to handle exceptions at various levels of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Categorization**: Custom exceptions can be categorized based on their severity or functionality, allowing developers to implement different error handling strategies for different types of errors. For example, an application might have exceptions for validation errors, database errors, or configuration errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Documentation and Communication**: Using custom exceptions helps in documenting the expected errors and communicating them to other developers who might use the code. It serves as a form of documentation that clarifies the error conditions and how they should be handled.\n"
