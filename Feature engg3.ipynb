    "Q1. **Data encoding**:\n",
    "   - Data encoding is the process of converting categorical data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "   - It is useful in data science because many machine learning algorithms require numerical inputs, and encoding categorical data allows us to use these algorithms effectively.\n",
    "   - By encoding categorical data, we can incorporate it into models and enable them to learn patterns and make predictions based on the categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **Nominal encoding**:\n",
    "   - Nominal encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category in a categorical feature.\n",
    "   - It is suitable for categorical features where there is no inherent order or hierarchy among the categories.\n",
    "   - Example: In a dataset containing a \"color\" feature with categories like \"red,\" \"green,\" and \"blue,\" nominal encoding would assign numerical values like 1, 2, and 3 to these categories, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **Preference for nominal encoding over one-hot encoding**:\n",
    "   - Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding when the categorical feature has many unique categories, which could result in a large number of new columns after one-hot encoding.\n",
    "   - One practical example could be a dataset containing a feature with country names. If there are hundreds of unique countries, using one-hot encoding would lead to the creation of hundreds of new columns, making the dataset sparse and increasing computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **Choice of encoding technique for a dataset with 5 unique categorical values**:\n",
    "   - If the dataset contains a small number of unique categorical values (e.g., 5), nominal encoding would be suitable.\n",
    "   - Nominal encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category, resulting in a single new column with numerical values representing the categories.\n",
    "   - This choice simplifies the dataset and avoids the potential sparsity issue associated with one-hot encoding when dealing with a small number of unique categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **Calculating the number of new columns after nominal encoding**:\n",
    "   - If there are 2 categorical columns with 5 unique values each, and each unique value is encoded using nominal encoding, then each categorical column would result in 5 new columns.\n",
    "   - Therefore, for 2 categorical columns, the total number of new columns created would be 5 + 5 = 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. **Encoding technique for a dataset containing information about animals**:\n",
    "   - Since the dataset likely contains categorical features such as \"species,\" \"habitat,\" and \"diet,\" and there may not be a natural order or hierarchy among these categories, nominal encoding would be suitable.\n",
    "   - Nominal encoding would assign numerical values to each category, allowing machine learning algorithms to process the categorical data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. **Encoding technique(s) for predicting customer churn**:\n",
    "   - For the \"gender\" feature, since there are only two categories (male and female), binary encoding or label encoding could be used.\n",
    "   - For the \"contract type\" feature, which likely has more than two categories, nominal encoding would be suitable.\n",
    "   - The \"gender\" feature could be binary encoded as 0 or 1.\n",
    "   - The \"contract type\" feature could be encoded using nominal encoding, assigning unique numerical values to each category.\n",
    "   - Age, monthly charges, and tenure are already numerical features and do not require encoding."
