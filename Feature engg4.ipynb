    "Q1. **Difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding**:\n",
    "   - **Ordinal Encoding**: Assigns a unique numerical value to each category in a categorical feature based on the order or rank of the categories.\n",
    "   - **Label Encoding**: Assigns a unique numerical value to each category in a categorical feature without considering any order or rank.\n",
    "   - Example: \n",
    "     - For a feature like \"Education Level\" with categories \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's,\" \"Master's,\" and \"PhD\":\n",
    "       - Ordinal Encoding would consider the order and assign values like 1, 2, 3, and 4 based on the education level's rank.\n",
    "       - Label Encoding would simply assign numerical values like 1, 2, 3, and 4 to each category without considering any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **Target Guided Ordinal Encoding**:\n",
    "   - Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique where categorical variables are encoded based on the target variable's mean or median value for each category.\n",
    "   - It is useful when the ordinal relationship between categories is not evident but the relationship with the target variable is significant.\n",
    "   - Example: In a loan default prediction project, encoding the \"Education Level\" feature based on the average default rate for each education level category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **Covariance**:\n",
    "   - Covariance measures the relationship between two variables. It indicates how much two variables change together.\n",
    "   - A positive covariance indicates a direct relationship, while a negative covariance indicates an inverse relationship.\n",
    "   - Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it helps understand how changes in one variable relate to changes in another.\n",
    "   - Covariance is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "     \\[ \\text{cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})}{n-1} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **Performing Label Encoding**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Sample data\n",
    "   data = {\n",
    "       'Color': ['red', 'green', 'blue'],\n",
    "       'Size': ['small', 'medium', 'large'],\n",
    "       'Material': ['wood', 'metal', 'plastic']\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Initialize LabelEncoder\n",
    "   label_encoder = LabelEncoder()\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Apply Label Encoding to each column\n",
    "   for column in data.columns:\n",
    "       data[column] = label_encoder.fit_transform(data[column])\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(data)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **Calculating the Covariance Matrix**:\n",
    "   - The covariance matrix is a matrix that shows the covariance between each pair of variables in a dataset.\n",
    "   - It is calculated using the covariance formula for each pair of variables.\n",
    "   - Interpretation depends on the context and the scale of the variables.\n",
    "   - Example: \n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Sample data\n",
    "     age = [30, 40, 50, 60]\n",
    "     income = [50000, 60000, 70000, 80000]\n",
    "     education_level = [12, 14, 16, 18]\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Calculate covariance matrix\n",
    "     data = np.array([age, income, education_level])\n",
    "     covariance_matrix = np.cov(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "     print(covariance_matrix)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. **Encoding methods for categorical variables**:\n",
    "   - **Gender**: Binary encoding (0 for Male, 1 for Female) as there are only two categories.\n",
    "   - **Education Level**: Ordinal encoding based on the level of education, as there's a natural order (High School < Bachelor's < Master's < PhD).\n",
    "   - **Employment Status**: Label encoding, as there's no inherent order among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. **Calculating Covariance between variables**:\n",
    "   - The covariance between continuous variables like \"Temperature\" and \"Humidity\" will indicate how they vary together.\n",
    "   - For categorical variables like \"Weather Condition\" and \"Wind Direction,\" converting them into numerical representations (e.g., using one-hot encoding) would be necessary before calculating covariance.\n",
